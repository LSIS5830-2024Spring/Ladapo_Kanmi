He has lost fractions of his blistering pace but his intelligence and manipulation of the football means his control over the result of games remains as strong as ever.

When Dr. Frank B Robinson first realized the dynamic implications of Psychiana, he was in debt, a humble drug clerk with no future, no hope. Now he possesses all that he wants of wealth, his mind is at peace, and he is accorded praise and renown as an outstanding and famous psychologist. The same forces that raised him out of the depths, to stand on a high plane among men, can be put to work for you."
